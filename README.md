# Elliptic-curve-Diffie-Hellman-ECDH-
Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) Key aggrement protocol implementation in python

Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is a key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.This shared secret may be directly used as a key, or to derive another key. The key, or the derived key, can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher. It is a variant of the Diffie–Hellman protocol using elliptic-curve cryptography.

The code demostrates the working of ECDH
